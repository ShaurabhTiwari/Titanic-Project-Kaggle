# Titanic-Project-Kaggle

A basic project in which we have to apply ML algorithms on training data to predict wheather a person survives or dies on the Titanic ship.

In this problem I have used Guassian Naive Baise Approach to train the model and to pridict the output. Also some of the preprossing tools are used like LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, SimpleImputer, ColumnTransformer, etc to preprocess the data.

# Libraries Used: 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sci-kit learn
4. Matplotlib.

# Results:
This model has shown an efficiency of 76.58% which is relatively good for any Machine Learning model. Whareas the maximum efficiency achieved by any model for this problem is ~83%
